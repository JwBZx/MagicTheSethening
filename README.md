# MagicTheSethening
Welcome to MagicTheSethening! This is a GitHub Repository dedicated to Magic The Gathering (which I got addicted to on [late] Friday [night], November 6th, 2015)! I might use this repository as a way to promote an app, publish a begineer's guide, or whatever I want to that is related to MTG! This repository will be dedicated to Seth who is one of my best friends and the person who got me into Magic The Gathering while at #ignite (#ignite2015)! Thank You for checking out this repository and God Bless! ---Jonathan Bruce (@JwBZx)
